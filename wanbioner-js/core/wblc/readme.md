# Wanbioner Lossless Compression | WBLC

Focus
- implement losless compression algorithm with specific usage that use Application / Algorithm / Or Non Human Readable Level Extreme on Wanbioner Core Common

Purpose
- use as data compression core common on level Extreme header size 1 (Extreme Compression that non Human Readable)

Target
- Latency Optimized For Use In (Data Transport, Monitoring , Networking , Audit)
- Storage Optimized For Use In (Data Storing, Archiving)

Research in this scope
- Studying Huffman Encoding (Variable Length)
- Studying Various Best Practice on this particular public available implementation
- Studying Neural Network based Compression Algorithm

insipired alot by zlib , lz4 , snappy , GAN , flac implementation
