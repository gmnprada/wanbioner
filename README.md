PI Wide Area Network Broker for Games Online , Use your Untapped resource to compute game online packet as SHARED BROKER on the NET.

Why its needed ?

So many of users cannot play online games because Internet Provider NAT their networks behind strict firewall or transparent proxying of dns. To Bypass that many users use VPN to simulate the Local Network Connection on and create Virtual Private Network for their online session or the GAMES Company Providing a CLOUD Server to use as a Broker.

if you use connection that did not has public IPv4 Address that casted to DMZ , port forwarded, or using UPNP feature of a ROUTER on the NET essentialy many of your packet is not delivered to other peers successfully,blocked by firewall,and not DELIVERED to other peers in time HANGING UNKNOWNLY on the VOID of THE NETWORK. that behavior cause some lag between peers or ghosting behavior that they did not see the other users they play with. the requirement is also hard and expensive to get in some Internet Service Provider. Games Online often need to provide server for their game and HOST MACHINE that acts as a Broker / Server to transport THE PACKET.

This Project AIM to provide that Wide Network for to be used on PI known APPS that relevant and FAST to use as Online Games or Multiplayer Games BASE NETWORK that need to communicate CLIENT data over the NET with aim of fast packet TRANSPORT that has LOW LATENCY OR SPECIFIED BY THE GAME and TUNNELED into SECURE NETWORKS.

Only the GAME PACKET allowed in with THEIR TOKEN and the TOPIC and packet TYPE the Games Online Needs and IGNORE other UNRELEVANT PACKET that passing the NETWORKS. The Requirement is that machine must has public IPv4 address to be used as a Router / Broker of GAMEDATA to only be used for a SERVICE OF COMPUTING GAME packet just like becoming a CLOUD SERVICE PROVIDER or DO A JOB OF A PUBLIC ROUTER that AUTOMATE share of the PAYMENT if THE PROMISED PACKET LATENCY succesfuly DELIVERED.

Essentialy this project also become A NET Of Shared Broker to use in the purpose of Multiplayer Game Only as Wide Area Network Route and integrated to your PI account.

The Focus and Scheme of the PROJECT
- Entering and Connected as a CLIENT that PLAY ONLINE GAME must PAY using PI balance and get a ticket till the specified time that TICKET Expired , DEFINE a Constant of Latency DESIRED for the GAME and THIS used as PROMISE REQUEST.
- The Broker That Run PIWAN Node with their public IP that acts as a Broker and transport facilitate Online Game Sessions Service, Essentialy TRANSPORTING PROMISE REQUEST DATA to PEERS they play and deliver it succesfully with the specified PACKET LATENCY , EARN from THAT TICKET share a PI Balance.

Instead of only use UNTAPPED RESOURCE ON MINING PI, IF YOUR DEVICE and UNTAPPED RESOURCE of the COMPUTER can ALSO DELIVER INTERNET BANDWITH RESOURCE to facilitate other as HOST of COMPUTING AND TRANSPORTING GAME PACKET NEEDS it will become CHALLENGE OF BUILDING MORE NETWORK NODE and GOOD TOPOLOGY to Meet the PROMISE REQUEST SPECIFICATION latency.

Maintaining NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE need alots of MONEY and PAYMENTS its undeniable cause USERS ALSO PAY their own ELECTRICITY and ISP BILLS to PROVIDE an ONLINE SERVICE and BECOME HOST to OTHER, SO WE BUILD This PROJECT so its AUTOMATE the REWARD of DOING PACKET TRANSFER OR BUILDING NETWORKS that FAST and HAS LOW LATENCY also SECURE TO USE.

ISP also has many WORK just the KEEP INTERNET GOING on BY MAINTAINING THE MACHINE or ROUTER THAT BROKER OUTDOOR so we need something to keep them MOTIVATED DOING THAT , WHAT IT IS IF IS NOT a CHALLENGE TO BE BETTER or a REWARDS to DOIT.
