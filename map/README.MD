it just named map , so employee knows the form if paper need to be transported into the board of direction its usually inside a map :p , and its also make you less confused in uknown area which no maps there to be used as source of direction to the place, google maps is not only map in the world.

why not just link into the docs or site? 

sometimes website with no maintainer also go down and the links is missing, its better to include it and pack all at once. its benefit people who working without internet connection also if they decide to print some documentation to be used as map of development in their sparetime. 

you never code inside a jungle right or middle of the ocean rights ? do it while camping or cruise and dont expect there is a always a link to internet there :v
